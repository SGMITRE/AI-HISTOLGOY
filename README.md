## Background

A computer vision algorithm was built for the purpose of identifying individual synovial nuclei in hematoxylin and esoin stained histological images.

## Requirements

To use the algorithm, the following pieces of computer software are required:

- A computer with any operating system (Windows, Linux, or MacOS)
- [Python 3.0+](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

## Python Packages
- skimage
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage

After downloading the required Python libraries, the algorithm can be applied to the image as described in the tutorial python notebook.

## File Descriptions

-   `segment.py` - contains functions relevant for nuclei segmentation
-   `tutorial.ipynb` - contains an example for identifying nuclei
-   `example_image.jpg` - example image provided for tutorial
